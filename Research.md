I have worked on research spanning a variety of topics, from Galactic dynamics in the Milky Way, strongly lensed supernovae, and now classical nova eruptions. More information about my work, along with links to relevant papers, are shown below. The descriptions on this page are intended to be fairly accessible, and won't include many technical details. For those, please either check out my papers, or email me and I'd be happy to elaborate.

### Galactic Dynamics

### Lensed Supernovae

### Classical Novae
