## Dr. Peter Craig's personal website


I grew up in upstate NY within the Adirondack park, which has lovely dark skies and has reasonably limited light pollution. I went to high school at Keene Central School in Keene NY, a small K-12 school with ~150 students. Hiking, skiing, swimming and other outdoor activities are quite popular there, and with easy access to the ADK mountains, I became an ADK 46er in high school. I still travel back to hike when I can.

Outside of astronomy, my interests include chess, books, video games, model rockets, model airplanes, and various outdoor activities like hiking, downhill skiing, and canoeing.  If you'd like to play a game of chess, feel free to send me an email or look me up on chess.com (username AdkPeter).
