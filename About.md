## Dr. Peter Craig's personal website


I grew up in upstate NY within the Adirondack park, which has lovely dark skies and has reasonably limited light pollution. I went to high school at Keene Central School in Keene NY, a small K-12 school with ~150 students. Hiking, skiing, swimming and other outdoor activities are quite popular there, and with easy access to the ADK mountains, I became an ADK 46er in high school. I still travel back to hike when I can.

Outside of astronomy, my interests include chess, books, video games, model rockets, model airplanes, and various outdoor activities like hiking, downhill skiing, and canoeing.  If you'd like to play a game of chess, feel free to send me an email or look me up on chess.com (username AdkPeter).

If you're interested in details of my education and work experiences, you can find my [CV](cv.pdf) below (or follow the link). For more information about my research and research interests, check out my [research page](/Research). My research publications are listed in my CV, but also can be found in my [Nasa ADS library](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/user/libraries/i8l8Zhc2SvqcowvBBFq67g).

To see examples of my code, check out my public [github portfolio](https://github.com/AdkPete/Portfolio). This mostly houses relatively simple versions of various algorithms that I've written. These aren't really intended directly for research use, but are useful for me to compare against other codes because I fully understand how they work.
