<p> First off, here is a link to my publication list at my <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/user/libraries/i8l8Zhc2SvqcowvBBFq67g">Nasa ADS Library page </a></p>.
<p> More to come here soon, but for now here is a short list of my research interests

<ul>
<li> Galactic Dynamics </li>
<li> Mass of the Milky Way </li>
<li> Measuring the Hubble Constant with Strong Gravitational Lensing </li>
<li> Physics of Classical Nova Eruptions </li>
<li> Classical Nova Bolometric Luminosities</li>
<li> Photometric colors of classical novae</li>
</ul>

Figure showing difference imaging based detection of a solar system body. This source was discovered during our survey searching for supernovae in strongly lensed galaxies. The top row of images show our difference images, and the original data frames are on the bottom row. These are three consecutive 5 minute exposures, and we see the object move from one frame to the next.
