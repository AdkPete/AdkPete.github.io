Hello! Welcome to Dr. Peter Craig's website! I am a postdoc in astronomy working at Michigan State University, with a focus on multiwavelength observations of classical novae. My Ph.D. work was completed at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), where I worked with Dr. Sukanya Chakrabarti on topics including Galactic dynamics and cosmology using gravitational lensing. For more information about me, check out the [About Me](/About) page. If you're interested in my research, take a look at my [Research](/Research) page, and to find my publications, this [Nasa ADS library](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/user/libraries/i8l8Zhc2SvqcowvBBFq67g) has an up-to-date list.
