<p> Welcome to my website! If you're interested in my research, and are an astronomer or otherwise familiar with some astronomical jargon, please take a look at my research page, which includes descriptions on my work and interests (and hopefully some nice plots). On the overview page, you can find a jargon-free, and ideally understandable, description of the things that I work on and why they are important. If anything is not understandable, please do let me know, you can find my email address at the bottom of this page (and all the other pages). You won't find any in depth technical info here, for that I'll refer you to the actual papers. If you'd like to learn a bit more about me, check out the about me page, and if you are here to learn about topics outside of astronomy, such as chess or model airplanes, check out the other page.

<br>
Some basic info is available here if this is what you are interested in. A copy of my CV can be found <a href="./CV.pdf"> here</a>, or a copy is displayed on the about me page. A list of publications can be found through my <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/user/libraries/i8l8Zhc2SvqcowvBBFq67g">Nasa ADS Library page </a>.

<br><br>

If you are interested in astronomy outreach, take a look at my outreach page. Here you can find links to public astronomy events in central Michigan, and a jargon free description of my research.
