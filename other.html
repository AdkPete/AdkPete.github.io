<h2> Chess </h2>

<p>
I am a strong (Class A / Expert level) chess player, and play a few local tournaments every year. Occasionally I'll also travel to play in some larger events, although I haven't been as active over the board lately. You can find me online on chess.com or lichess (username ADKPeter on both), where I play blitz frequently. If you'd like to play a game feel free to reach out!
</p>

<p>
Here is a link to my <a href="https://www.uschess.org/msa/MbrDtlMain.php?14924441">US Chess Federation page</a>, where you can see my ratings and recent tournaments and similar info, in case you are interested. I've spent some time working as a chess coach / teacher for the Rochester Chess Center back when I was a graduate student (until the pandemic in 2020 that is). If you'd be interested in arranging for some chess lessons, or organizing a local chess club / class / tournament, please email me, and we can talk! I'm happy to plan online events as well.

<h2> Model Rockets </h2>

<p>I've been building model rockets ever since I was young (thanks to my father and grandfather). Mostly small ones, due to limited launch site areas, but I've built a few large (high-powered) models as well. Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/2EIciBWLR28"> video </a> of a model rocket launch for a rocket that was 3D printed at the local library in Keene Valley, Ny. This launch was an experiment to see if we could build a small, recoverable and reusable rocket with just 3D printed parts (plus an engine, parachute and some elastic material). It worked, the rocket landed safely and is still flyable today! </p>

<h2> Model Airplanes </h2>
<p>
This is a relatively new hobby for me. I used to fly occasionally with my uncle and father years ago, flying a model Cessna. I'm just now starting to really get into the hobby, which seems well-timed since one of the largest RC airfields in the state of Michigan is just a bit outside of Lansing. I've been flying a Carbon Cub S2 for a few months now, and am having a great time with it! As of December 2024, I'm temporarily not flying much while I get some better equipment for winter flying.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully in the next few weeks I'll have some floats for the plane, plus some equipment to keep my hands warm enough while using the transmitter. I figure that the floats ought to enable takeoff and landing off of snowy fields, perfect for a Michigan winter. I'm planning to get into models of historical aircraft (warbirds especially), but am waiting until spring and better weather for that.
