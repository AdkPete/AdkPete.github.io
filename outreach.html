<h1> Public Outreach</h1>
</head>

<body>

<p> This page details my outreach activities, and those of the MSU observatory. If you are interested in the chance to see the night sky through a telescope, you should check out the MSU observatory public nights, with the schedule available <a href='https://web.pa.msu.edu/astro/observ/visitors.html#when'>here</a>. These are great events, with an assortment of telescopes available and many astronomers around to answer any questions that you might have.

<br><br>

Currently, these nights are my primary outreach activity, but I'm always looking for more opportunities to engage with the public. If you have an event that you think I could help with, or if you'd like to arrange a talk or a visit to your school or organization, please email me and we can discuss the details. I'm happy to talk about astronomy, my research, or any other topic that you think might be interesting.
