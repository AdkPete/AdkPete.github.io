<h1> Public Outreach</h1>
</head>

<body>

<p> This page details my outreach activities, and those of the MSU observatory. If you are interested in the chance to see the night sky through a telescope, you should check out the MSU observatory public nights, with the schedule available <a href='https://web.pa.msu.edu/astro/observ/visitors.html#when'>here</a>. These are great events, with an assortment of telescopes available and many astronomers around to answer any questions that you might have.

If you're organizing a stargazing event and would like an astronomer (with a telescope) to be there to show off the night sky, feel free to email me. If it works in my schedule there is a good chance that I would be willing to attend, and offer viewing of planets and other interesting celestial bodies.

<h2 style="text-align:center" > My Research </h2>
<p>
This section contains a description of my research that is intended to be accessible without requiring any particular astronomical knowledge or jargon. The goal is to describe the problems that we are working on (and how we go about that), as well as why this is interesting. My research here is organized in reverse chronological order, so we start with my current work and end with my oldest research.

<h3 style="text-align:center"> Classical Nova Eruptions </h3>
<p>
As a postdoc at MSU, my focus is on understanding the physics behind classical nova eruptions. So first of all, what is a classical nova (or nova for short)? Novae are eruptions that occur on the surface of a white dwarf star (the remnant of a sun-like star, now reduced to just a hot core that has run out of useable fuel). This causes the star to become vastly brighter than it was before. These eruptions are triggered when a white dwarf manages to accumulate gas from another star, usually hydrogen. If enough hydrogen is gathered, it is able to begin burning this material on the white dwarf surface, causing the eruptions known as novae. Due to the dense environment on the surface of such a star, this leads to a runaway nuclear reaction, triggering the release of a massive amount of energe (though not as massive as a supernova).

<br><br>

My work aims to understand how these eruptions work, especially in regards to gas that gets ejected from the white dwarf during these events. We are doing this by using available data in the NASA mission archives (and from other, ground based places) for more than 100 nova eruptions. This will let us test models against the observations from a large statistical sample of nova eruptions. By combining observations that cover large parts of the electromagentic spectrum, ranging from the infrared all the way up to gamma rays, across many novae, we can learn a lot about the underlying physics. There remains much that is not understood relating to how nova eject mass during the eruption, and especially about the formation of shock waves inside of the ejected material. We know that the situation is rather complicated, and likely varies significantly from one nova to another.
